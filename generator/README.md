**Hi there ðŸ‘‹**, My name is **Asmir Mustafic** and
currently I'm working at [getyourguide.com](https://www.getyourguide.com).

My core skills are build around  the
[PHP](https://github.com/php/php-src/)  and the [Symfony](https://symfony.com/) world.
If I have to choose a database, most of the time it would be [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/).

Recently I have been working with Java and TypeScript.

I maintain a bunch of different PHP projects, some of them are:
